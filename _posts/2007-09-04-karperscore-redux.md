In my [earlier post]({% post_url 2007-09-02-karperscore-is-born %}), I provided a quick-n-dirty solution to the problem of devising a superior system of scoring songs played in [Amarok](http://amarok.kde.org/).
After giving the problem some thought, I have come up with a different approach.

The score of a song represents the computer's best guess of how much you, the user, likes a certain song.
Unlike the rating, the score requires little user input.
Of course, if the rating is provided, the computer can predict the score a lot more reliably.
In any case, the parameters that the computer can track and use in determining the score of a song are as follows:

- the previous/current score of the song (`prevscore`: 0-100)
- the rating of the song (`rating`: 0-10)
- the play count of the song (`playcount`: 0-inf)
- the percentage of the song listened to now (`percentage`: 0-100)

How important are each of these parameters in judging the score of the song?
The `prevscore` is our current best guess and needs to be refined.
The `rating` is the absolute indication of how much you like the song.
But over time, it is likely to be obsolete---the user may grow to like or dislike the song over time and the rating might not be relevant over time.
The `playcount` indicates how obsolete the user's `rating` is likely to be.
If the `playcount` is high, it is possible that despite a low `rating`, the user does indeed like the song quite a bit.
Finally, the `percentage` of the song that was just played is an important, though limited parameter in our decision---it's altogether likely that the user had to stop the song because of an important call, for example.

In what follows, the code is provided in the [Ruby programming language](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/).

Let's start with the `prevscore`.
It's our initial best guess of how much the user likes the song.
If the song was never played before, the score would be returned as a default value, 0.
Just to make sure it is so, the first if statement sets this:

{% highlight ruby %}
if ( playcount <= 0 )
  prevscore = 0
{% endhighlight %}

We need to next consider the `rating` of the song.
Again, it's possible that the `rating` is not present for the song.
In that case, the computer must make a decision.
Conservatively, I start it off at a `rating` of 5 - that's two and a half stars.

{% highlight ruby %}
if ( rating <= 0 )
  rating = 5
{% endhighlight %}

The choice of the '<=' logical operator is inspired by the [default Amarok scoring script](http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/FAQ#How_are_track_scores_determined.3F).
Now, we are ready to make our first guess at the new score.

{% highlight ruby %}
guess1 = ( 5 * rating ) + ( prevscore / 2 )
{% endhighlight %}

In other words, the `rating` and the `prevscore` are averaged.
Let's examine the stability of this guess.
It's immediately clear that this algorithm will always approach the condition `prevscore = 10*rating`.
This was the basis of my first solution.

To improve our guess, the `playcount` must be considered.
If the `playcount` is high, it should reasonably imply a higher score.
This guess must be bounded by the user's `rating` and the maximum, 100.
A good candidate function to execute this gradual move from the user's rating to 100 is the [exponential decay function](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_decay).

{% highlight ruby %}
guess2 = guess1 + ( 100 - guess1 ) * ( 1 - Math.exp( -playcount / 100 ) )
{% endhighlight %}

The `playcount` is divided by 100 to make the typically fast exponential decay a hundred times slower.
Over hundreds of plays, the song's score will now drift away from the user's `rating` towards 100.

Finally, the `percentage` variable is brought in.
This variable has the potential to wreck havoc on any algorithm---indeed it was the primary reason why I embarked on this endeavor in the first place.
On the other hand, we must recognize the potential to introduce a little ambiguity in the scoring process.
It does become boring to stare at a score forever pinned at 99.
A little disturbance in the Force might be a good thing from time to time. :)
In order to contain the damage this variable can do, I let it have control of 10% of the current best guess â€” `guess2`.
If the song is immediately skipped, the score will drop to 90% of its current value.

{% highlight ruby %}
guess3 = guess2 * ( 0.9 + 0.1 * percentage / 100 )
{% endhighlight %}

A final look at the stability of this algorithm is warranted.
Initially, the `prevscore` will tend towards the `rating`, barring the effect of sub-100 `percentage` values.
As the `playcount` increases into the hundreds, the exponential function will invariably take over and take the score towards 100.
The `percentage` can disrupt this from time to time, but the score will always return back towards 100.

This, then is the thought process that went into the design of [KarperScore 2.0](http://kde-apps.org/content/show.php?content=65466).
It's currently in testing.
I'll release it as soon as I'm sure it's working as I expect it to.
The future improvements to this code should let the user decide parameters like the default `rating`, or the relative importance of the `percentage` variable to the score, etc.

## Update

What a difference the class of the variable makes!
Many of the variables above, such as `playcount` were initialized as integers and the exponential function likes floats!
So, the score was jumping all over the place.
Now, all variables have been initialized as floats and that solved all the bugs I noticed with the script during testing.
The script is ready for general release as far as I can tell, but a couple of days more of testing the code is always a good idea.

## Update 2

KarperScore has been working so well for me over the past couple of weeks that I've been using it that I wish I could reset all my `playcount`s and `score`s, to start all `score`s fresh.
I need to ask someone on the Amarok IRC channel (#amarok on irc.freenode.net) if that's possible at all...

I did a simulation of how the `score` of a song varies over one hundred plays, assuming that the user sets a (constant) `rating` when the song is listened to for the first time.
That's why the `score`s always start at 25 for each of the three cases - no `rating` (blue), full `rating` (red) and minimum `rating` (green).
I also assumed that the user listened to the song in its entirety everytime it's played (`percentage = 100`).

[ Image lost ]

Clearly, for an unrated song, the `score` approaches 100 leisurely, making it to about 88 after the user listened to the song for the hundredth time.
It's a good guess of how much the user might like the song after so many plays.
If the `rating` is specified, the `score` tends faster or slower than this.
The fastest rise is for the five-star rated songs---the `score` passes 90 if the song is played just four times.
The lowest minimum `rating` possible is a half-star.
Note how the `score` approaches the rating over the first few plays and then slowly climbs as the song collects more playcounts.
When played for the hundredth time, the `score` reaches about 80.
