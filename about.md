# This blog...

This is a documentation of helpful things like user guides and unhelpful things like personal reports all mixed into one.
I mean for this blog to be rather code-heavy, with all of it publicly available to use, modify and share.

# The name...

I hoped the name would convey a sense of unraveling or simplifying explanation of something that originally was rather opaque and intimidating.
The 'k' in the name is to associate this to the [KDE project](http://www.kde.org/), my contributions to which I hope will soon come to dominate most of the content of this blog.

# The symbol (Ꮬ)...

The Ꮬ symbol is the unicode character U+13DC, named CHEROKEE LETTER DLA.
I picked it because at first glance, it looks all twisty and complicated, but is actually something you can draw in a single fluid curve.

# The author...

I'm Karthik Periagaram.
I am geek.
I've tinkered with almost everything I've come in contact with.
Perhaps as a result of that, I support and use free and open source software as much as I can.
I hope to give back to the community by contributing code to the KDE project.
Soon, err, one of these days, uh, as soon as I get that other thing figured out...
