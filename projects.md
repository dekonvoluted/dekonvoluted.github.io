# libspe

A C++ library to work with SPE files

This project was started in 2009 when I needed a way to import data from SPE files into C++ code.
It uses the Eigen linear algebra library to abstract image frames as matrices.
The latest release was in 2015.

# Equilibrium

A Qt application to calculate gaseous equilibrium

Equilibrium was envisioned in 2011 as a successor to GasEQ, a Windows-only gas equilibrium calculator.
After a burst of activity that managed to transcribe most of the GasEQ equations in LaTeX, the project lost momentum.
The project has been in cold storage for several years now.

# archive

A python script to make incremental backups

Started in 2014, it uses rsync to make incremental backups using hard links to avoid duplication of unchanged files.
I use this script to make my weekly backups.
The latest release was in 2016.

# normalizeFLAC

A ruby script to normalize a directory full of FLAC files

Created in 2014, it uses recursive calls to metaflac to normalize files.
The latest release was in 2014.

# musync

A ruby script to synchronize a portable music library to an upstream lossless one

Created in 2014, it uses lame to transcode a FLAC library into an mp3 one for portability.
The latest release was in 2016.

# antfarm

A Qt implementation of Langton's ant

Written in 2015 as a way of teaching myself the Qt graphics view framework, it implements a simple automaton called Langton's ant.
The project has yet to see its first release.

# subsync

A ruby script to synchronize an SRT subtitle file with audio/video

Started in 2016, this script parses an SRT file and allows easy manipulation of timecodes.
The project has yet to see its first release.
